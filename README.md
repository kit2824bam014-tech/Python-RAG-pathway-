# Python-RAG-pathway-
A narrative audit engine that combines Pathway’s document parsing and vector search with Gemini LLM reasoning.   This project ingests book collections and backstory datasets, splits them into semantic chunks, embeds them for retrieval, and queries Gemini to evaluate causal consistency between evidence and narrative.
